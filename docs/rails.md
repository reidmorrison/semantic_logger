## Rails

The `rails_semantic_logger` gem replaces the default Rails logger with Semantic Logger.
It also reduces Rails logging output in production to almost a single line
for every Controller-Action call.

### Rails Support

For the complete list of supported Ruby and Rails versions, see
the [Testing file](https://github.com/reidmorrison/semantic_logger/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml).

### Installation

Add the following lines to Gemfile

~~~ruby
gem 'amazing_print'
gem 'rails_semantic_logger'
~~~

The gem `amazing_print` is optional, but is recommended to get colorized output of semantic data
(Hash output).

Install required gems with bundler

    bundle install

This will automatically replace the standard Rails logger with Semantic Logger
which will write all log data to the configured Rails log file.

### Conflicting Gems

Remove all of the following gems since they conflict or duplicate what Rails Semantic Logger already
achieves.

* lograge
* rails_stdout_logging
* rails_12factor

### Process Forking

See [Process Forking](forking.html) if you use Unicorn or Puma.

### Heroku

#### Log to standard out.

When running on Heroku all logging needs to be set to standard out.

Add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`:

~~~ruby
if ENV["RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT"].present?
  $stdout.sync = true
  config.rails_semantic_logger.add_file_appender = false
  config.semantic_logger.add_appender(io: $stdout, formatter: config.rails_semantic_logger.format)
end
~~~

Heroku sets the `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` environment variable to `true`.

#### Setting the log level.

The log level is usually set with the config setting `config.log_level`, but
Heroku also allows the log level to be set via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

`heroku config:set LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`

To enable the above log level environment variable for Heroku, add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`:

~~~ruby
if ENV["LOG_LEVEL"].present?
  config.log_level = ENV["LOG_LEVEL"].downcase.strip.to_sym
end
~~~

### Configuration

The configuration can be set in either `config/application.rb` or the environment specific file in
`config/environments`.

#### Standard Rails log output for a single page request

![Rails Default](images/rails_default.png)

#### Rails log output for the same single page request after adding the `rails_semantic_logger` gem:

![Rails Single Line](images/rails_single_line.png)

#### Re-enable Started, Processing, and Rendered messages

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.started    = true
config.rails_semantic_logger.processing = true
config.rails_semantic_logger.rendered   = true
~~~

![Semantic](images/rails_semantic.png)

#### Original Rails messages with semantic logger formatting

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.semantic   = false
config.rails_semantic_logger.started    = true
config.rails_semantic_logger.processing = true
config.rails_semantic_logger.rendered   = true
~~~

![Semantic Disabled](images/rails_semantic_false.png)

#### Include the file name and line number in the source code where the message originated
**Warning:** Either set this to `nil` (to disable it completely) or to a high log level (`:fatal` or `:error`) in your production environment otherwise you risk encountering a memory leak due to the very high number of 
objects allocated when Ruby backtraces are created. This is best used in development for debugging purposes.

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.backtrace_level = :info
~~~

![with_source](images/rails_with_backtrace.png)

The above output shows 3 web requests where the source file name was `log_subscriber.rb` and line number `11`.

#### Log Level

To change the log level:

~~~ruby
# Set to the log level to :trace, :debug, :info, :warn, :error, or :fatal
config.log_level = :debug
~~~

To change the log level when running inside of a running Rails console:
~~~ruby
SemanticLogger.default_level = :debug
~~~

#### Named Tags

Named tags can be added to every log message on a per web request basis, by overriding the Rails built-in
`config.log_tags` with a hash value.

For example, add the following to application.rb, or replace the existing `config.log_tags` entry:

~~~ruby
  config.log_tags = {
    request_id: :request_id,
    ip:         :remote_ip,
    user:       -> request { request.cookie_jar['login'] }
  }
~~~

Note:
* If a value returns nil, that key and value will be left out of the named tags for that request.
* `:request_id` above is for Rails 5 and above. With Rails 4.2 use `:uuid`

To turn off named tags in development, add the following to `config/environments/development.rb`
~~~ruby
config.log_tags        = nil
~~~

#### Rails Console Logging

By default the Rails Semantic Logger adds a logger to stderr when running inside a rails console.

To disable this behavior:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.console_logger = false
~~~

#### Quiet asset logging

Rails logs asset retrievals at the debug level. These log entries can quickly clutter the log output:

~~~
Rack -- Started -- {:ip => "127.0.0.1", :method => "GET", :path => "/assets/rocket_job_mission_control/rocket-icon-64x64.png"}
~~~

To turn off the asset logging:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.quiet_assets = true
~~~

#### Colorize Logging

If the Rails colorized logging is enabled, then the colorized formatter will be used
by default. To disable colorized logging in both Rails and Semantic Logger:

~~~ruby
config.colorize_logging = false
~~~

#### Semantic log output

By default Action Controller and Active Record text messages are converted to semantic data (Hash):

~~~
Rack -- Started -- { :ip => "127.0.0.1", :method => "GET", :path => "/users" }
UserController -- Completed #index -- { :action => "index", :db_runtime => 54.64, :format => "HTML", :method => "GET", :mongo_runtime => 0.0, :path => "/users", :status => 200, :status_message => "OK", :view_runtime => 709.88 }
~~~

To disable semantic message conversion:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.semantic = false
~~~

#### Started message

By default the Started message is logged at the debug level so that it does not appear in production.

~~~
Rack -- Started -- { :ip => "127.0.0.1", :method => "GET", :path => "/users" }
~~~

To show Rack started messages in production:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.started = true
~~~

#### Processing message

By default the Controller Processing message is logged at the debug level so that it does not appear in production.

~~~
UserController -- Processing #index
~~~

To show the Controller Processing message in production:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.processing = true
~~~

#### View Rendering messages

By default the Action View rendering messages are logged at the debug level so that they do not appear in production.

~~~
ActionView::Base --   Rendered data/search/_user.html.haml (46.7ms)
~~~

To show the Action View rendering messages in production:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.rendered = true
~~~

#### Awesome Print Options

The default Awesome Print options can be changed by supplying any valid Awesome Print options:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.ap_options = {multiline: false}
~~~

The defaults can also changed be creating a `~/.aprc` file.
See the [Amazing Print Documentation](https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print)

Notes:

* The option `:multiline` is set to false if not supplied.
* Has no effect if Awesome Print is not installed.

### Additional appenders

Example, also log to a JSON log file, for consumption by ELK, Splunk, etc.:

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.add_appender(file_name: "log/#{Rails.env}.json", formatter: :json)
~~~

Example, also log to a local Syslog:

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.add_appender(appender: syslog)
~~~

Example, also log to a local Syslog such as syslog-ng over TCP:

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.add_appender(appender: syslog, url: 'tcp://myloghost:514')
~~~

Example, also log to elasticsearch:

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.add_appender(appender: :elasticsearch, url: 'http://localhost:9200')
~~~

Example, also log to BugSnag:

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.add_appender(appender: :bugsnag)
~~~

See [Appenders](appenders.html) for the complete list of available appenders.

#### Output Format

The Rails log file and Rails Server standard out logging can be modified directly with the format config option.

~~~ruby
  config.rails_semantic_logger.format = :default
~~~

Valid options:
* :default
    * Plain text output with no color.
* :color
    * Plain text output with color.
* :json
    * JSON output format.
* :one_line
    * Reduce each log message to a single line.
* `Object`
    An instance of any class that derives from `SemanticLogger::Formatters::Base`.

* `Proc`
    A block that will be called to format the output.
    It is supplied with the `log` entry and should return the formatted data.

Note:
* `:default` is automatically changed to `:color` if `config.colorize_logging` is not `false`.

JSON Example, in `application.rb`:
~~~ruby
  config.rails_semantic_logger.format = :json
~~~

Custom Example, create `app/lib/my_formatter.rb`:
~~~ruby
  # My Custom colorized formatter
  class MyFormatter < SemanticLogger::Formatters::Color
    # Return the complete log level name in uppercase
    def level
      "#{color}log.level.upcase#{color_map.clear}"
    end
  end
~~~

In `application.rb`:
~~~ruby
  config.rails_semantic_logger.format = MyFormatter.new
~~~

See [SemanticLogger::Formatters::Color](https://github.com/reidmorrison/semantic_logger/blob/master/lib/semantic_logger/formatters/color.rb) for the other methods that can be overridden.

To modify and use a different base formatter choose from [the complete list of formatters](https://github.com/reidmorrison/semantic_logger/tree/master/lib/semantic_logger/formatters).

#### Disable default Rails file logging

When running in an environment where local file logging is not available, or to completely replace the file logger,
disable the default rails file logging by setting:

~~~ruby
config.rails_semantic_logger.add_file_appender = false
~~~

After disabling the default file logging another appender needs to be added before any logging will be sent anywhere.
For example to create a JSON only log file:

~~~ruby
config.semantic_logger.add_appender(file_name: 'log/json.log', formatter: :json)
~~~

Notes:
* If the default file logger is not used then any logging failures will be written to stderror.
* When running the Rails server, it automatically adds an appender that logs to standard out.
    * To disable the Rails server standard out logging add the following option when starting it from the command line:
        * `bin/rails s --daemon`
    * Or if running Puma, add the `--quiet` option.
* It is usually a good idea to turn off standard out logging in production.

#### Adding custom data to the Rails Completed log message

During Controller-action processing custom data can be added to the Rails Completed message.

Add a method called `append_info_to_payload` to the controller to modify the payload that is logged:

~~~ruby
class ThingController
  private

  def append_info_to_payload(payload)
    super
    payload[:user_id] = 42
  end
end
~~~

#### Log file name and line number

In development to log the file and line number from which every log message originated:

~~~ruby
# Log file name and line number for log messages at this level and above
config.semantic_logger.backtrace_level = :debug
~~~

By default backtraces are only captured for `:error` and `:fatal` levels since capturing a backtrace
for every log message is expensive.

This feature can be used in production, but use with care since setting the level too low will slow down the application.

### Custom Controller Base Class

If your application is using a custom controller base class other than `ActionController::Base` or `ActionController::API`,
then Rails Semantic Logger will fall back to the `ActionController::Base` logger instance.
This is not ideal since all log entries from that controller will now have the name `ActionController::Base`.

To make the log entries use the correct class name add the following to your custom controller class:
~~~ruby
include SemanticLogger::Loggable
~~~

Or, if the custom controller base class is inside of a third party gem, add an initializer with:
~~~ruby
CustomControllerBase.include(SemanticLogger::Loggable)
~~~

Where `CustomControllerBase` is the name of the custom controller base class.

### Log Rotation

Since the log file is not re-opened with every call, when the log file needs
to be rotated, use a copy-truncate operation over deleting the file.

Sample Log rotation file for Linux:

~~~
/var/www/rails/my_rails_app/shared/log/*.log {
        daily
        missingok
        copytruncate
        rotate 14
        compress
        delaycompress
        notifempty
}
~~~

### Replacing Existing loggers

Rails Semantic Logger automatically replaces the default loggers for the following gems
after they have been initialized:

- Bugsnag
- Mongoid
- Mongo
- Moped
- Resque
- Sidekiq
- Sidetiq
- DelayedJob
