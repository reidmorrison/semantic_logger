## Programming Guide

### Logging levels

The following logging levels are available through Semantic Logger

    :trace, :debug, :info, :warn, :error, :fatal

The log levels are listed above in the order of precedence with the most detail to the least.
For example `:debug` would include `:info`, `:warn`, `:error`, `:fatal` levels but not `:trace`.
`:fatal` only logs `:fatal` error messages and nothing else.

`:trace` is a new level that is often used for tracing low level calls such
as the data sent or received to external web services. It is also commonly used
in the development environment for low level trace logging of methods calls etc.

### Changing the global default log level

By default Semantic Logger will only log `:info` and above. To log everything to
the log file set the global default log level to `:trace`:

~~~ruby
require "semantic_logger"

# Override the default log level of :info so that :debug and :trace are also logged
SemanticLogger.default_level = :trace

SemanticLogger.add_appender(file_name: "development.log", formatter: :color)

logger = SemanticLogger["MyClass"]
logger.info "Hello World"
logger.trace "Low level trace information"
~~~

All loggers and appenders use the global `SemanticLogger.default_level` by default
unless they have been explicity set to another level. In which case changing
`SemanticLogger.default_level` will not affect that particular logger or appender.

### Creating an instance of a logger

To create a stand-alone logger instance by supplying the name of the class/application:

~~~ruby
logger = SemanticLogger["MyClass"]
~~~

Or, even better, pass the actual class itself:

~~~ruby
logger = SemanticLogger[MyClass]
~~~

A logger instance should be created for every class so that its log entries
can be uniquely identified from logging entries from other classes.

All logger instances forward their log messages to the global Appender Thread that
does the actual logging to each appender, see [Appenders](appenders.html) for a list of available
Appenders.

#### Using the SemanticLogger::Loggable Mixin

Rather than creating logger instances above inside classes it is recommended to
use the SemanticLogger::Loggable Mixin by adding the following include:

~~~ruby
  include SemanticLogger::Loggable
~~~

For Example:

~~~ruby
class Supplier
  # Include class and instance logger variables
  include SemanticLogger::Loggable

  def self.some_class_method
    logger.debug("logger is accessible from class methods")
  end

  def call_supplier
    logger.debug("logger is accessible from instance methods")
  end
end
~~~

This will result in the log output identifying the log entry as from the `Supplier` class

    2012-08-30 15:37:29.474 I [48308:main] Supplier -- logger is accessible from instance methods

### Standard Logging methods

The Semantic Logger logging API supports the existing logging interface for
the Rails and Ruby Loggers. For example:

~~~ruby
logger.info("Hello World")
~~~

Or to query whether a specific log level is set

~~~ruby
logger.info?
~~~

The following traditional logging methods are available

~~~ruby
logger.trace("Low level trace information such as data sent over a socket")
logger.debug("Debugging information to aid with problem determination")
logger.info("Informational message such as request received")
logger.warn("Warn about something in the system")
logger.error("An error occurred during processing")
logger.fatal("Oh no something really bad happened")
~~~

Each of the above calls can take additional parameters, for example:

~~~ruby
log.info(message, payload_or_exception = nil, exception = nil, &block)
~~~

Parameters

- message
    - The text message to log.
    - Mandatory only if no block is supplied
- payload_or_exception
    - Optional, either a Ruby Exception object or a Hash
- exception
    - Optional, Ruby Exception object.
    - Allows both an exception and a payload to be logged
- block
    - The optional block is executed only if the corresponding log level is active.
    - By supplying a block, it is only evaluated when the log level meets or exceeds the supplied log level.
    - This can be used to prevent the block from being evaluated in production environments.

Examples:

~~~ruby
logger.debug("Calling Supplier")

logger.debug("Calling Supplier", request: "update", user: "Jack")

logger.trace { "A total of #{result.inject(0) {|sum, i| i+sum }} were processed" }
~~~

An alternative API is to pass everything in a Hash, including the message.

~~~ruby
logger.debug(message: "Calling Supplier")

logger.debug(message: "Calling Supplier", payload: {request: "update", user: "Jack"})

# Log a complete exception
logger.error(message: "Calling Supplier", exception: exception)

# Add a 100ms duration to the log entry
logger.error(message: "Calling Supplier", duration: 100)

# Add a count metric ( with a value of 1 )
logger.error(message: "Calling Supplier", metric: "Supplier/inquiry")

# Add a count metric with a value of 21
logger.error(message: "Calling Supplier", metric: "Supplier/inquiry", metric_amount: 21)

# Add a duration metric
logger.error(message: "Calling Supplier", metric: "Supplier/inquiry", duration: 100)
~~~

### Exceptions

The Semantic Logger adds an optional parameter to the existing log methods so that
a corresponding Exception can be logged in a standard way

~~~ruby
begin
  # ... Code that can raise an exception
rescue Exception => exception

  # Log the exception as an error
  logger.error("Oops external call failed", exception)

  # Re-raise or handle the exception
  raise exception
end
~~~

### Payload

The Semantic Logger adds an extra parameter to the existing log methods so that
additional payload can be logged, such as a Hash or a Ruby Exception object.

~~~ruby
logger.info("Oops external call failed", result: :failed, reason_code: -10)
~~~

The additional payload is machine readable so that we don't have to write complex
regular expressions so that a program can analyze log output. With the MongoDB
appender the payload is written directly to MongoDB as part of the document and
is therefore fully searchable

### Measure Everything

It is important to "measure everything" in a production application so that when things slow
down it is obvious where the slow down is coming from.

~~~ruby
logger.measure_info "Called external interface" do
  # Code to call external service ...
end
~~~

The following output will be written to file:

    2012-08-30 15:37:29.474 I [48308:ScriptThreadProcess: script/rails] (5.2ms) Rails -- Called external interface

The log message is only written once the block completes and includes how long it
took to complete.

If an exception is raised during the block, the exception message will be logged
at the same log level as the measure along with the duration and message.
After logging the exception is re-raised unchanged.

The following measuring methods are available:

~~~ruby
logger.measure_trace("Low level trace information such as data sent over a socket") do ... end
logger.measure_debug("Debugging information to aid with problem determination") do ... end
logger.measure_info("Informational message such as request received") do ... end
logger.measure_warn("Warn about something in the system") do ... end
logger.measure_error("An error occurred during processing") do ... end
logger.measure_fatal("Oh no something really bad happened") do ... end
~~~

#### Elastic Logging

With elastic logging the log message should only be logged when the minimum duration has been exceeded.

For example, Memcache calls are usually very fast, log when it takes longer than 3 ms to complete:

~~~ruby
logger.measure_warn "Called memcache", min_duration: 3 do
  # Code to call memcache ...
end
~~~

#### Metrics / Dashboards

By measuring the time taken to execute a block of code and then assigning a metric to it,
the duration can be aggregated into a dashboard.

~~~ruby
logger.measure_info "Called external interface", metric: "Supplier/inquiry" do
  # Code to call external service ...
end
~~~

The log level can be supplied dynamically as the first parameter to:

~~~ruby
logger.measure(:info, "Informational message such as request received")
~~~

Each of the above calls take additional optional parameters:

~~~ruby
log.measure_info(message, params=nil) do
  # Measure how long it takes to run this block of code
end
~~~

Measuring calls take two parameters, the first is a mandatory text message, the
second is a Hash of settings:

- `:log_exception` [Symbol]
    - Control whether or how an exception thrown in the block is
      reported by Semantic Logger.
    - Values:
        - `:full`
            - Log the exception class, message, and backtrace.
        - `:partial`
            - Log the exception class and message. The backtrace will not be logged.
        - `:off`
            - Any unhandled exception raised in the block will not be logged.
        - Default: `:partial`

- `:min_duration` [Float]
    - Only log if the block takes longer than this duration in `ms`.
    - Very useful to make a log entry only appear when the specified minimum duration
      has been exceeded, which is ideal for isolating the cause of application slow-downs.
    - Default: 0.0 ( Always log )

- `:payload` [Hash]
    - Optional, Hash payload

- `:exception` [Exception]
    - Optional, Ruby Exception object to log along with the duration of the supplied block.

- `:duration` [Float]
    - Optional, supply the duration in ms that is logged when a block is not supplied.
    - If a block is not supplied then :duration is mandatory.
    - If a block is supplied :duration is ignored.

- `:metric` [String]
    - Optional, when this parameter is supplied all subscribers will be notified of this metric.

- `:silence` [Symbol]
    - Optional, the log level to silence all log messages to within the block.
    - `silence` is thread-safe and only affects messages logged on the current thread.

- `:on_exception_level` [Symbol]
    - Optional, If an exception is raised, increase the log level to this level.

Example

~~~ruby
logger.measure_info "Called external interface",
    log_exception: :full,
    min_duration:  100,
    metric:        "Custom/Supplier/process" do
  # Code to call external service ...
end
~~~

If the duration is already available, it is possible to use the same measure logging
and manually supply the duration without a block. This ensures that the duration is
logged in a semantic way rather than inserting the duration into the text message itself.

~~~ruby
duration = Time.now - start_time
logger.measure_info "Called external interface", duration: duration
~~~

Note: Either a code block or `:duration` must be supplied on all measure calls

### Tagged Logging

Tagged logging adds the specified tags to every log message within the supplied block.
If a new thread is created within the block the logging tags are not automatically
copied to that thread. See [Parallel Minion](https://github.com/reidmorrison/parallel_minion)
for a library that creates threads and automatically copies across any logging tags to the
new thread.

Using Tagged logging is critical in any highly concurrent environment so that
one can quickly find all related log entries across all levels of code, and threads.

~~~ruby
tracking_number = "15354128"

SemanticLogger.tagged(tracking_number) do
  # All log entries in this block will include the "tracking_number" logging tag
  logger.debug("Hello World")
end
~~~

It is recommended to name tags since using just the tag values can be confusing, especially when
a system grows over time. Named tags are easier to identify and alert off of when a centralized logging
system is being written to.

~~~ruby
SemanticLogger.tagged(user: "Jack", zip_code: 12345) do
  # All log entries in this block will include the above named tags
  logger.debug("Hello World")
end
~~~

### Named threads

Semantic Logger logs the name or id of the thread in every log message.

On Ruby MRI the thread name is by default the thread's object_id, For example: 70184354571980

~~~
2013-11-07 16:25:14.279627 I [35841:70184354571980] (0.0ms) ExternalSupplier -- Calling external interface
~~~

To set a custom name for any thread so that it shows up in the logger:

~~~ruby
Thread.current.name = "User calculation thread 32"
~~~

Sample output:

~~~
2013-11-07 16:26:02.744139 I [35841:User calculation thread 32] (0.0ms) ExternalSupplier -- Calling external interface
~~~

When running JRuby, `Thread.current.name` will also set the underlying thread name in the JVM
which is very useful when monitoring the JVM via JMX using tools such as jconsole.

#### NOTE:

Make sure that the assigned thread name is unique otherwise it will be difficult
to distinguish between concurrently running threads if they have the same name.

For example, use the current thread object_id to ensure uniqueness:

~~~ruby
Thread.current.name = "Worker Thread:#{Thread.current.object_id}"
~~~

### Silencing noisy logs

Silence noisy log levels by changing the default_level within the block.

This setting is thread-safe and only applies to the current thread.

Any threads spawned from within the block will not be affected by `silence`.

~~~ruby
# Silence all logging below :error level
logger.silence do
 logger.info "this will _not_ be logged"
 logger.warn "this neither"
 logger.error "but errors will be logged"
end
~~~

`silence` can also lower the log level within the supplied block. For example
to increase log information in diagnosing a specific issue.

~~~ruby
# Perform trace level logging within the block, even when the default is higher
SemanticLogger.default_level = :info

logger.debug "this will _not_ be logged"

logger.silence(:trace) do
 logger.debug "this will be logged"
end
~~~

#### Note

`silence` does not affect any loggers which have had their log level set
explicitly. I.e. That do not rely on the global default level.

### Debug logging as Trace

Some third party gems log a large amount of information at debug level since they
do not use Semantic Logger and do not have access to the `:trace` level for logging.

To map the `:debug` logging calls for these existing libraries to `:trace`, replace
its logger with an instance of `DebugAsTraceLogger::SemanticLogger`

~~~ruby
# Example, log debug level messages as trace:
logger = SemanticLogger::DebugAsTraceLogger.new("NoisyLibrary")

# This will be logged as :trace
logger.debug "Some very low level noisy message"
~~~

### Changing the log level for a single class at runtime

Since the logger is class specific, its log level can be changed dynamically at runtime.
For example, to temporarily set the log level to `:trace` to diagnose an issue:

~~~ruby
require "semantic_logger"

SemanticLogger.default_level = :info
SemanticLogger.add_appender(file_name: "example.log", formatter: :color)

class ExternalSupplier
  # Lazy load logger class variable on first use
  include SemanticLogger::Loggable

  def call_supplier(amount, name)
    logger.trace "Calculating with amount", { :amount => amount, :name => name }

    # Measure and log on completion how long the call took to the external supplier
    logger.measure_info "Calling external interface" do
      # Code to call the external supplier ...
    end
  end
end

# Create and use the class
supplier = ExternalSupplier.new
supplier.call_supplier(100, "Jack")

# Now change the log level to :trace
ExternalSupplier.logger.level = :trace

# Call the supplier, this time including trace level messages
supplier.call_supplier(100, "Jack")

# Change the log level back to the global default level
ExternalSupplier.logger.level = nil
~~~

Below is the output from the above example showing the `:trace` log level message
that was written during the second call to the ExternalSupplier:

~~~
2013-11-07 16:19:26.496 I [35674:main] (0.0ms) ExternalSupplier -- Calling external interface

2013-11-07 16:19:26.683 T [35674:main] ExternalSupplier -- Calculating with amount -- {:amount=>100, :name=>"Jack"}
2013-11-07 16:19:26.683 I [35674:main] (0.0ms) ExternalSupplier -- Calling external interface
~~~

#### Change the log level without using signals

If the application has another means of communicating without needing signals,
the global default log level can be modified using `SemanticLogger.default_level=`

~~~ruby
# Change the global default logging level for active loggers
SemanticLogger.default_level = :debug
~~~

### Flushing the logs

Semantic Logger automatically flushes all appenders ( log files, etc. ) when a process
exits.

The `flush` method is not defined for Semantic Logger instances since there could be
many logging instances, sometimes one per class.

To perform a global flush of all appenders and to wait for any outstanding queued
messages to be written:

~~~ruby
# Flush all appenders and wait for them to complete flushing
SemanticLogger.flush
~~~

### Replacing loggers in other Gems

Rails Semantic Logger already replaces the loggers for the following Gems, but
if Semantic Logger is being used stand-alone, then these need to be called from
within your code as needed:

~~~ruby
# Replace the Resque Logger
Resque.logger = SemanticLogger[Resque] if defined?(Resque) && Resque.respond_to?(:logger)

# Replace the Sidekiq logger
Sidekiq::Logging.logger = SemanticLogger[Sidekiq] if defined?(Sidekiq)

# Replace the Mongoid Logger
Mongoid.logger = SemanticLogger[Mongoid] if defined?(Mongoid)
Moped.logger   = SemanticLogger[Moped] if defined?(Moped)
~~~

### Causal Exceptions

When an exception is caught and then a new one is raised, Ruby automatically adds the original caught exception
to the new exception as its cause.

Example function that raises a new exception:

~~~ruby
def oh_no
  f = File.new("filename", "w")
  # Will raise: IOError: not opened for reading
  f.read
rescue IOError
  raise RuntimeError.new("Failed to write to file")
end
~~~

Calling the above function and then logging the exception:

~~~ruby
require "semantic_logger"
SemanticLogger.add_appender(io: $stdout, formatter: :color)
logger = SemanticLogger["Demo"]

begin
  oh_no
rescue StandardError => exception
  # Semantic Logger will log both the exception and the causing exception
  logger.error("Failed calling oh_no", exception)
end
~~~

Both the `RuntimeError` and the `IOError` will be logged:

~~~
2017-05-03 09:45:38.948029 E [17641:70311685126260 demo.rb:17] Demo -- Failed calling oh_no -- Exception: RuntimeError: Failed to write to file
demo.rb:6:in `rescue in oh_no'
demo.rb:2:in `oh_no'
demo.rb:14:in `<main>'
Cause: IOError: not opened for reading
demo.rb:4:in `read'
demo.rb:4:in `oh_no'
demo.rb:14:in `<main>'
~~~

The output above contains 2 stack traces, with the second stack trace starting at
`Cause: IOError: not opened for reading`.

### Synchronous Operation

Some users have requested the ability to bypass the separate logging thread.
It forces logging to be performed in the current thread, instead of being performed asynchronously.
Of course this means that all logging is performed in the current thread slowing it down, 
depending on how many and which log appenders are being used.

It is _not_ recommended to use this feature since it disables a core design principle in Semantic Logger
itself. If your application is single threaded and is not time critical, performing logging in the
current may be useful for your application though.

Some scenarious where it could be useful.
- In forked environments not having to re-create the logging thread.
- Short lived execution where creating a separate thread and then waiting for it to terminate on
  exit may nor be desirable.
- Logging maintains the current threads context.
- Very few Ruby applications actually use threads.

Run Semantic Logger in Synchronous mode:
~~~ruby
SemanticLogger.sync!
~~~

_Note:_ The above config option must be called _before_ any appenders have been added.

To guarantee that the above sync config option is enabled, replace the regular require statement
with one that forces synchronous logging:
~~~ruby
require "semantic_logger/sync"
~~~

Or, when using a Gemfile:
~~~ruby
gem "semantic_logger", require: "semantic_logger/sync"
~~~

### Child Logger

It is possible to create child loggers with pre-set instance tags.
Any log message emitted by a logger with pre-set instance tags will include these tags along with the message data.

~~~ruby
logger = SemanticLogger["MyClass"]
child_logger1 = logger.child(tag1: "value1", tag2: "value2")
child_logger2 = child_logger1.child(tag3: "value3")

# Will include tag1, tag2, tag3 and tag4 in the output
child_logger2.info("Some message", tag4: "value4")
~~~
