- As noted above deprecated arguments have been removed, so the following code, if any:
~~~ruby
SemanticLogger::Appender::File.new($stderr, :warn)
~~~

~~~

## [4.0.0]

- Any payload elements passed into the log line must now be specified in a separate :payload tag.
    - For example any occurrences of:
    ~~~ruby
    logger.error(message: 'Hello', response: response_message)
    ~~~

    - Must be changed to use the payload tag:

    ~~~ruby
    logger.error(message: 'Hello', payload: {response: response_message} )
    ~~~

    - Otherwise Ruby will raise the following error:

    ~~~
    ArgumentError: unknown keywords: response

    ~~~

- For JSON and Hash appender format, payload is now in its own :payload tag instead of being merged into the hash.

- Appenders use the new common formatters where applicable.
- Appenders now use custom formatters as the `#call` method for better performance over blocks.
- Bugsnag appender will now forward `:fatal` errors, since some were being ignored and
