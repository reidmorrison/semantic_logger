      # Parameters:
      #   batch_size: [Integer]
      #     Maximum number of messages to batch up before sending.
      #     Default: 300
      #
      #   batch_seconds: [Integer]
      #     Maximum number of seconds between sending batches.
      #     Default: 5

      # See SemanticLogger::Appender::Async for other paramaters
      #
      # Note:
      # * `lag_check_interval` is not applicable to batches, since the first message of every batch
      #   is the oldest and is always checked to see if the lag interval has been exceeded.
